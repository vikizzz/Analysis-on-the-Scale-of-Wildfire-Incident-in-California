Also, our project is going to be done for academic use, instead of commercial purpose. Looking at the data sources we are going to use in the project, which may be from the website of Kaggle. According to the privacy terms of Kaggle, we have the rights to download the dataset, but we are not allowed to modify or exploit other ways without the prior consent of the datasets’ owners. Besides Kaggle, we would always adhere to the principles of data privacy, and we will use the data if and only if we have the permission to do so. Accuracy of data from kaggle should be doubted and evaluated. To eliminate the inaccuracy of the data, we can choose some data values (yearly acres burned by the wildfire, temperature for specific day, or fatalities) and search them separately, comparing them to examine their liability. \n",
